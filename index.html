          Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to hypothesize the existence
          of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly

            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
            physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
            at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
            venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
            particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
            discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
            potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could
            have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
            repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
            of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
            heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped
            mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
            irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
            diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
          </p>

          <p class="main-text">
            “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page
            and drew a double box around it.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
            that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
            hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of
            cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers
            led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
            Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time —
            so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
            wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
            trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought
            smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his
            colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
            many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
            science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing
            the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
            realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending
            14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of
            galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
            extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our
            own universe there might be an endless number of other universes
            bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling
            over.

              In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
              operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
              accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
              Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of
              gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
              general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
              Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
              expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big
              as it gets.”
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
              He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
              sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
              The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a
              bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a
              picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot
              as the surface of the sun.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
              Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
              Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic
              Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at
              the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers
              submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

                  INFLATION solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less
                  than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe
                  expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the

            inflation had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded
            with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think
            that if this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest
            discoveries in the history of science.”
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor
            and head of a competing project called the South Pole Telescope,
            pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are
            beautiful and very convincing,” he said.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation
            that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of
            genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his
            model, but he expressed reservations about inflation.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the
            need for confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier
            estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the
            European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about
            the universe.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr.
            Krauss said.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft
            will report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams
            are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and
            space.

            <p class="main-text">
              Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of
              the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno
              Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the
              Nobel Prize.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
              Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these
              waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a
              series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South
              Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions.
              The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie
              Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of
              Stanford.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
              “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be
              on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he
              said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he
              said.

              In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave
              radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight
              preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
              This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the
              gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in
              one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would
              twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists
              said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have
              little arrows going in spirals.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
              Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small
              differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s
              telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting
              thermometer.

              “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
              The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they
              spent a year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making
              sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might
              beat them to the breakthrough.

            <h2>A Special Time</h2>
            <p class="main-text">
              The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists
              like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years
              ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the
              universe.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
              Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today:
              gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But
              they have long suspected that those are simply different
              manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe
              in its earliest, hottest moments.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
              As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall
              from grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers
              falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one
              force after another splitting away.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
            <p class="main-text">
              Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the
              temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at
              which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
              Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified
              state too long. In that case, space itself would become imbued
              with a mysterious latent energy.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
              Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as
              a kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up.
              Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more
              space was created, the harder it pushed apart.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
              What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at
              least a trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of
              primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a
              cosmic eye-blink.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
              Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into
              ordinary particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was
              still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of
              sky and stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said
              that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to
              say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
              Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting
              from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once
              started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a
              comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue
              blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known
              as the multiverse.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
              So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do
              not bother asking about going any deeper into the past.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
              We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very
              beginning, because inflation erases everything that came before
              it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are
              swept away, forever out of our view.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
              “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a
              Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the team, “you
              wind up at inflation.”
